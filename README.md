## üí° Project Overview

The **Pet Expense Tracker** is a simple, zero-setup web application designed to help pet owners easily manage and track all their pet-related spending.

This project is built as a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**, following a strategic **Two-Stage Development** plan:

1.  **Stage 1 (Current)**: A free, fully functional, client-side application to validate the idea, gather user feedback, and build an initial audience.
2.  **Stage 2 (Future)**: A premium, subscription-based version with advanced features like cloud sync, user authentication, and multi-pet support.

The app is built with pure **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, making it incredibly lightweight, fast, and easy to deploy on any static hosting platform.

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

The Pet Expense Tracker is a static site and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Recommended Deployment Method: GitHub Pages (Simplest)

This method is the easiest way to get a live URL and requires no separate hosting account.

1.  **Create a New Repository**: On your GitHub account, create a new public repository (e.g., `pet-expense-tracker`).
2.  **Upload Files**: Upload all the project files (HTML, CSS, JS folders, and all root files) to the `main` branch of this repository.
3.  **Enable Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository's **Settings** tab.
    *   Navigate to the **Pages** section.
    *   Under "Source," select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Click **Save**.
4.  **Live URL**: Your app will be live within a few minutes at a URL like:
    `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/pet-expense-tracker/`

### Alternative Deployment: Netlify (Recommended for Continuous Integration)

Netlify's free tier is generous and offers automatic deployment on every commit.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Ensure your project is on GitHub (Step 1 above).
2.  **Connect to Netlify**:
    *   Log in to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/).
    *   Click **"Add new site"** -> **"Import an existing project"**.
    *   Connect to GitHub and select the `pet-expense-tracker` repository.
3.  **Configure Build**:
    *   **Build command**: Leave empty (static site).
    *   **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory).
    *   Click **Deploy site**.

## üí∞ Monetization Strategy (Stage 2 Roadmap)

This MVP is designed to be a foundation for a profitable application.

### Stage 1 (Current) Monetization:

*   **Affiliate Marketing**: Integrate targeted affiliate links for pet products (food, insurance, toys) within the dashboard or history view.
*   **Google AdSense**: Place non-intrusive banner ads to generate passive income.

### Stage 2 (Future) Premium Features:

Once the app has a solid user base, the following features will justify a subscription fee (e.g., $29/month, as per the original plan):

| Feature | Justification for Premium |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cloud Sync & Auth** | Securely sync data across multiple devices and provide user accounts. |
| **Multi-Pet Support** | Track expenses for multiple pets separately. |
| **Advanced Reporting** | Generate monthly/annual reports, charts, and data export (CSV/PDF). |
| **Budgeting Tools** | Set spending limits and receive automated budget alerts. |
| **Ad-Free Experience** | Remove all advertisements for paying users. |

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting & Support

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1.  **Check Browser Console**: Press F12 and look for any red error messages in the Console tab.
2.  **Clear Cache**: Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R).
3.  **Verify Paths**: Ensure that the file paths in `index.html` (`css/styles.css` and `js/app.js`) are correct relative to the root folder.

For platform-specific support, please consult the official documentation for GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
